SmartShop E-Commerce Web App

SmartShop is a responsive front-end e-commerce web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates core web development concepts including dynamic product rendering, shopping cart management, DOM manipulation, and client-side data persistence using the browser’s localStorage API.

The application displays products in a modern card-based layout and allows users to add items to a shopping cart, track quantities, remove products, and view the total price updated in real time. Cart data is stored locally so selections remain saved even after refreshing the page, simulating basic real-world online shopping behavior.

This project is designed as a practical learning implementation of interactive UI design and JavaScript-driven functionality without using external frameworks.
